<p>In a city of many architectural excesses, the Albert Hall Jaipur is possibly the most decorative and visually stunning. The large concert hall was constructed in 1876 for one sole purpose, to ensure Prince Albert of England would visit Jaipur during his tour of the country. This extravagant gesture by the Maharaja guaranteed the prince’s visit and today the Albert Hall Jaipur has been converted into Albert Hall Museum (Central Museum) that displays relics from Jaipur’s history.</p><p><font size="4"><b>History</b></font></br>The Albert Hall Museum is named in honour of Prince Albert of Britain (Queen Victoria’s husband) and was constructed to entice him to visit Jaipur during his 1876 tour of the Indian subcontinent. It was important for Maharaja Ram Singh to have the prince visit Jaipur as this would strength ties to the British royal court. The other extravagance that the Maharaja performed was ensuring the city was painted pink as a sign of welcoming and this tradition continues.The Albert Hall Jaipur was designed by a British architect, Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, who combined India Islamic architecture with neo-gothic that was fashionable in the Victorian era. This style of architecture is referred to as Indo-Saracenic and the Albert Hall Museum is the finest example in Rajasthan. Prince Albert ceremonially laid the first stone of the building to be named after him and the ceremony took place on the 6th of February 1876. The complex was completed 10 years later in the reign of Madho Singh II who decided the Albert Hall Jaipur should be used as a museum instead of a government building as Madho Singh I had planned.</p><p><font size="4"><b>Attractions</b></font></br>In an attempt to depict the uniqueness of the dresses and jewelry of all the classes and tribes of Rajasthani people the galleries on the ground floor of the museum have been completely remodeled and restructured since 1959 including the privileged class that mainly consists of Rajputs and the merchant class. Lifestyle of the tribals such as Meenas, Bhopas, Bhils, Gadoliya Lohars are included. One gallery shows the heena body art of Rajasthan, which is known as “Mehndi Mandana” , which shows an exhibition of the typical Rajasthani motifs and designs that are rigourslyl recognized as ethic all over the world.</p>
