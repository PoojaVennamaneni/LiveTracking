<p><font size="4"><b>Brief History and Evolution of the Museum</b></font></br>The Salar Jung Museum houses the largest one-man collection of antiques in the world. It is well known throughout India for its prized collections belonging to different civilizations dating back to the 1st century. Nawab Mir Yusuf Ali Khan Salar Jung III (1889â€“1949), former Prime Minister of the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, spent a substantial amount of his income over thirty five years to make this priceless collection, his life's passion. The collections left behind in his ancestral palace, 'Diwan Deodi', were formerly exhibited there as a private museum which was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1951. Old timers believe that the present collection constitutes only half of the original art wealth collected by Salar Jung III. His employees siphoned off part of it, since Salar Jung was unmarried and depended upon his staff to keep a vigil. Some more art pieces were lost or stolen during the shifting of the museum from Diwan Deodi to the present site.[3] Later in 1968, the museum shifted to its present location at Afzal Gunj and is administered by a Board of Trustees with the Governor of Telangana as ex officio chairperson under the Salar Jung Museum Act of 1961.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Founders</b></font></br>Salar Jung Museum is the passion and dream of Mir Yusuf Ali Khan, also known as Salar Jung III. He was the creator of this exceptional collection. He was then the Prime Minister of Nizam* of Hyderabad. Mir Yusuf Ali Khan spent more than 35 years of his life looking out for precious items. Salar Jung Museum was opened to public on 16 December 1951. The museum was earlier the ancestral palace of Mir Yusuf Ali Khan. It was then known as 'Diwan Deodi'. The private museum was inaugurated by then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1968, entire museum was shifted to its present location.</p>
<p<font size="4"><b>Museum Highlights</b></font></br>Salar Jung Museum highlights the lifestyle of many civilizations: Indus, Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Roman, around the world. It has over 40,000 art items and 50,000 books. The exhibits include Indian art, Islamic art, European displays, Persian carpets and Middle and Far Eastern art. The Indian art collection comprises stone sculptures, metal wares and paintings. The most popular display is 'Veiled Rebecca*' by Italian Sculptor Giovanni Benzoni. The world famous statue of Veiled Rebecca shows her beautiful face hazily visible through a flimsy marble veil. The fine carving of the stone actually gives the impression of a veil over the statue.

Another equally famous sculpture is a 19th century two sided wooden statue done by an Italian sculptor. On the front side there is a Man (Mephistopheles) and on the other side is Margaretta a woman, who is seen reflected in the mirror placed behind. It symbolises good and evil. The same log of wood is used to carve two diametrically opposite characters.</p>
