<p><font size="4"><b>History</b></font></br>The roots of the National Museum begin with an exhibition of Indian art and artefacts at the Royal Academy in London in the winter of 1947-48.[4] At the end of the London exhibition, the exhibition curators had decided to display the same collection intact in India before returning the artefacts to their individual museums. The Indian exhibition was shown at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in 1949, and was so successful that it led to the decision to form a permanent National Museum. On 15 August 1949, the National Museum was formally inaugurated by the then Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. At that time, it was decided that until a permanent home could be found for the collection, it would continue to be housed at the Rashtrapati Bhawan.

The cornerstone of the present museum building was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, on 12 May 1955, and the building formally opened to the public on 18 December 1960.

Today, the Museum is administered and funded by the Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Tourism.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Vision & Mission </b></font></br>The vision / motto of National Museum isTo collect art objects of Historical, Cultural and Artistic significance for the purpose to display, protection, preservation and interpretation (research).
To disseminate knowledge about the significance of the objects in respect of history, culture and artistic excellence and achievements. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Modelling</b></font></br>The Modelling section was established in 1960 for the production and sale of replicas of artefacts made in 'Plaster of Paris' (POP). Several objects have been carefully selected from the collection of artefacts representing the vast history of five thousand years of Indian art, and replicas are made manually with great skill. Due to their high artistic quality, these replicas always remain in great demand with the visitors to the museum.</p>
